CGM tools is a collection of tools I programed during my PhD and a series of
project where I needed repeated structures or scripts to make very similar
tasks. I decided to pack, document and share them since it might be usefull
for somebody else.
What you will find is the documentation, source code and unit tests to use the
different modules and to force me to keep some minimum level of quality.

.. Note::
    This code is deliverated made compatible just with Python 3.x since I don't
    want to use python 2.x anymore due to several reasons that are not relevant
    or this document. Python is cool and I embrace you to use it even inversin
    1.x if you want (I would not recomend that), but I strongly recoment to use
    3.x which is the one compatible with these tools,
